usage:  [opts] [time]

[opts] can be any combination of the following options.
Test Enable Options: (by default, these tests are skipped)
-a Run the S.M.A.R.T. drive polling test
-b [bytedir]
   Run the BYTE benchmarking suite as part of the test.
   You must install the BYTE suite seperately, and give the
   directory for it.
-C Run the crashme test.
-c Run disk tests on the CD-ROM drive.
-f Run disk tests on the PC Floppy drive.
-g [ltpdir]
   Run the SGI Linux Test Project tests in a loop.
   This requires the seperate installation of the Linux Test Project
        tests.
-i Run disk tests on all IDE/SCSI/USB Floppy drives.
-j Run disk tests on all JAZ drives.
-K Run the fast kernel (one copy) compile test with
   (2*CPUs) parallelization.  This option automatically skips
   the standard kernel compile test.
-l Run the lm_sensors monitor (requires lm_sensors installed and
   configured)
-M [n] Run the maxalloc probe with a certain value as the ceiling.
   This will prevent the maxalloc probe from exercising a certain
   Linux VM strangeness, and will speed up initialization of the
   test.  Default value is 4000.
-N [device1],[device2],[device3],... 
	Run data R/W test on devices [device1], etc
        [devicen] may be a NFS hostname:/share
	style specifier to test NFS.
-p n Add data R/W test to all R/W partitions
     on drives configured for disk test with minimum
     parallelization n.
-r Run RR's memory tester at 64K. (cache exerciser)
-R Run RR's memory tester at 16 MB. (main memory exerciser)
-S Run the system log duplicator.
-t Run RR's burnP6/burnK6.
-3 Enable 3ware array monitoring.  Requires 3ware's cli.
-w Enable kernel diff test


Test Disable Options: (by default, these tests are run)
-k    Skip the kernel compile test with 2xCPUs parallelization.
-m    Skip Larry's memory tester (memtst).
-n    Skip all disks on disk tests (disabling all disk tests).
-s    Skip the system log monitors.
-p    Skip data R/W tests.
-x    Skip crash detection (not a test)

Other:
-h This help screen.
-2 Use a 2 GB Maximum File Size limit for the -p/-N test.  Default is 
   ~2TB limit.
-v Verbose mode, print test successes as well as failures.
-V Enable old-style VM thrashing as part of the VM test (restores pre 
1.3.0 default behavior)
-A [timeframe] 
	Enable Automonkey support:  exit test on completion (-z) when
	the current time is in the range specified.
	Time frame format is:
		SMTWUFA-0000-2359
	Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday thUrsday Friday sAturday
	from 0000h to 2359h in 24 hour time.  No, you can't straddle
	midnight with a time range at present.
-B [path]
	Set kernel compiles to occur in this directory instead
	of /home/tmplinux.  Directory contents are forfeit!
-G God mode.  Ignore fatal errors.
-d Open the CD-ROM tray on errors or on printing "test complete" with -z.
-D Open the CD-ROM tray on errors only.
-I For I Want A Broken Backplane.  Use this to ignore < 10 DAC960 resets.
-z [time]
	Print "test complete" after [time].  This doesn't affect the test
	otherwise.


[time] is a time specifier:
AdBhCmDs = A days, B hours, C minutes, D seconds.  You can omit parts, e.g.
15s for 15 seconds.  The test will terminate after the timeout.  By default
it will run forever.
