   The following components used in the Cerberus Test Control System were
   authored by outside sources:
	flushb.c -- from e2fsprogs package, under the GPL.
	cpuburn-1.2 -- Robert Redelmeier <redelm@ev1.net>, GPL.
        crashme.c -- from crashme-2.4 by George C. Carrette, free to modify
        	with no restrictions except maintenance of the copyright notice.
        	(See runin/src/crashme/crashme.c for details)
	
   Please do not contact the authors of these programs about problems
   with the test suite -- in many cases I have modified the software myself
   and it is inappropriate to contact the original authors about problems
   I may have caused.
