Porting Cpuburn on ARM

* Cortex A8

To begin, I studied the Cortex-A8 and I have found that the Neon is the entity which consume the more.
So all my code is build with Neon's instructions.
There is only two pipes in the Cortex-A8 so I try to always have this pipes full.
In the first part I initialize my loop by entering variable in Neons registers.
Then I begin my loop with Neon's Instructions.

At the begining, I had this loop :

loop:
    subs    r1, #1
    bne     loop

I know that my processor is at 600mHz and I do 4 000 000 000 iterations so I can find the number of cycle.And I saw that this loop takes 3 cycles. 
After that, I added instructions in the loop to see which instructions cost 0 cycle or which instructions can be parallelized.
This leads me to the actual loop which takes 4 cycles.

At Texas Instruments, I have boards which allow me to measure temperature and power.

Here is the results for temperature :
	idle :	 	35 C
	empty loop :	38 C
	Burn : 		43 C

And the power measure gives:
	idle :		262 mW
	empty loop :	365 mW
	burn : 		693 mW

Measurement of power are done on the Omap3630 in the cpu's rail and measure of temperature with the band gap temperature sensor.

When i quit the loop, I do a test to see if the computation is good, if not the programm exit.

To compile this program, I use codesourcery toolchain :  arm2009q1.


* Cortex A9

The Neon is the entity which consumes the more like on Cortex A8.
So I began my research on the Neon with the same method as Cortex A8.
Here the empty loop take only one cycle due to "Fast loop mode".
I managed to use two Neon's entity at the same time : load and multiply.
We can't use more Neon's instructions in parallel so we need to use other instructions to complete the pipeline.
So I try with Arm instructions and I managed to add two ARM instructions in parallel of Neon's instructions.

At the end, I have a loop of 3 cycles with 4 instructions in parallel.

I get this results on an omap4 board with two Cortex-A9 :

	 --------------- -----------------------------------------------
	|		| Delta of temperature  | Delta of consumption	|	
	|---------------|----------------------------------------------	|
	|1*burnCortexA9 | + 12 C		| + 0.6 W		|
	|	        |			|			|
	|1*burnCortexA8 | + 11 C		| + 0.56 W		|
	|		|			|			|
	|2*burnCortexA9 | + 26 C		| + 1.26 W		|
	|		|			|			|
	|2*burnCortexA8 | + 28 C		| + 1.16 W		|
	|		|			|			|
	----------------------------------------------------------------			

I tested burnCortexA9 on omap3 too and I get a delta of 560 mW between burnCortexA8 and burnCortexA9. (BurnCortexA8 is still the best on omap3).
