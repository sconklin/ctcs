BE WARNED.  This software can and will destroy data on your system, so
don't run it until you have went over the documentation and understood
what the software does.  If your hardware/kernel is flaky, data loss is
very possible.  Do not run on a production system!  That said, people do
do it anyway, but I can't be responsible if you lose data because of it.  
See README.FIRST for details.
